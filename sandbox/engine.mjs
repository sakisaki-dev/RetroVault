   Each week every active, healthy player plays one game (weeks 1–17 of each 20-week season); at season's end come awards,
   a Super Bowl, retirements (each replaced by a rookie at the same position and club), and changes in form. Value is the
   site's own formula (OVR percentile within position over the game's pool, skill, Career Legacy, Hall of Fame, tier)
   recomputed every week from the simulated totals. It never reads a price or a bot. */
